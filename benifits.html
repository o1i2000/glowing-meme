<div> <h3>Cost</h3>
                    <p> Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software <br>- Round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling and the IT experts<br> for managing the infrastructure.</p>
</div>
                
<div> <h3>Speed</h3>
                    <p> Most cloud computing services are<br> provided as self service and on<br> demand, so even vast amounts of <br>computing resources can be provisioned<br> in minutes, typically with just a <br>few mouse clicks, giving businesses <br>a lot of flexibility and taking<br> the pressure off capacity planning.</p>
</div>
<div><h3>Scale</h3>
                    <p>The ability to scale elastically. <br>That means delivering the right <br>amount of IT resources – for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth – right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.</p></div>  
  <div><h3>Productivity</h3>
                    <p> On-site data centres typically require a lot of work and hardware setup.<br> Cloud computing removes the <br>need for many of the tasks, so IT<br> teams can spend timeon achieving<br> more important business goals.</p></div>
  <div><h3>Performance</h3>
                    <p> The biggest cloud computing services <br>run on a global network of<br> secure data centres, which are<br> regularly upgraded to the latest<br> generation of fast and efficient<br> computing hardware. This offers several<br> benefits over a single corporate data centre.</p></div>
  <div><h3>Security</h3>
                    <p> Many cloud providers offer a <br>broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping to protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats.</p></div>
