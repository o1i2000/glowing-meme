<div> <h4> Public Cloud </h4>
            <p> 
                Public clouds are owned by thrid party service providers who deliver their services over the internet. Some companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide these services. You dont have to buy any infistructure or hardware as it is all provided over the internet</p>
</div>
            
<div> <h4> Private Cloud </h4>
            <p> 
                Private clouds are used excusivley by a single company. These can be phisically located on the company property or some use thrid party serices so they dont use up space and money. Private cloud infistructuer can be more secure then going to a public company.
                </p>
</div>
            
<div> <h4>Hybrid Cloud </h4>
            <p> 
                Hybrid clouds are a mix of both public and private clouds. They allow data to be shared between both public and private networks. This form of cloud computing allows for a larger flexibility for the company, while also offering greater security and deployment options
